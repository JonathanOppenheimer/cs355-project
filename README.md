# CS 355 Project

Welcome to our project for CS 355: Introduction to Crypotgraphy. To test our solution, please follow the steps below.

## Installation

First, Python must be installed. Please visit [the official Python site](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for download and install.

Next, install the external libraries (listed in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt)) for our solution. 

```
cd cs355-project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Testing 

To test our solution, open two terminal windows. Run `python bob.py` first in one, and then `python alice.py` in the other. Our protocol will then be executed. Feel free to play around with the code segments available in [alices-code](./alices-code/) and [bobs-code](./bobs-code/).
